# Say Hi App 👋

This is a super simple Python app that shows a window with a button.  
When you click the button, it says **Hi!** in the terminal.

## 💻 What You Need

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)

If you don’t have Python yet, you can download it here:  
👉 [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure to check the box that says **“Add Python to PATH”** when installing on Windows!

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Download or clone this repo. *(I recommend saving it to your Desktop.)*
2. Double-click the `say_hi.py` file to run it!

That’s it! A small window will pop up with a button — click it, and you'll see **Hi!** in the terminal or command prompt.

## 🧠 What It Uses

This app uses the built-in **Tkinter** library that comes with Python.  
No extra installs needed!
